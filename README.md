# Blazor and ML.NET
### Jan 31, 2018 - Michael Chu

### Abstract:
[Blazor](https://blazor.net/) is a new .NET Single Page Application Framework. [ML.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet) is an open source and cross-platform machine learning framework. Both technologies are still in preview mode.

In this talk, I will introduce mostly Blazor with an example on how to integrate with ML.NET into the application.

### Speaker Bio:
I am a senior .NET application developer working as consultant for [Cloudtrend](https://www.cloudtrend.ca/) in Edmonton specialized in building customized enterprise web solutions. As the president of Edmonton .NET user group, I enjoy meeting peers in this space and chat about related technologies. On my spare time, I love spending time with my wife and kids, and investing in the stock market.
